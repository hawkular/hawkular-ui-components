*Hawkular UI Components* is the home of UI Components that comprise the Hawkular console for https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular[Hawkular].  This console is based on https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/blob/master/docs/Overview2dotX.md[Hawt.io 2], which a javascript based client-side framework. The various directories underneath console directory are Hawt.io 2 plugins and the various plugins eventually compose a Hawkular console. This modular approach to creating hawtio console plugins allows us to create individual plugins that comprise a console or can easily  be plugged into other Hawtio based consoles. The plugin system makes it easy to add/remove functionality (even dynamically).

== Bower Component

This git repository is published as bower component and consumed by the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular/ui/console/README.adoc[Hawkular Console]. Assets such as html/css/images/javascript can be published.



== Directory Structure

*dist* - directory for  artifacts that need to published via bower package.

*plugins* - directory containing Hawt.io 2 plugins for  Hawkular console. Multiple plugins can be packaged into a single bower component by adding the artefacts to the 'main' section of the bower.json file.

The general idea here being that Hawt.io UIs which are composed of plugins (that can swapped around like legos between the various other Hawt.io UIs)

== Dev Install
_Dev Installs allow for live previewing changes as development occurs. Its an interactive environment that allows one to prototype quickly, seeing their changes instantly when they save since the browser refreshes with the changes._

Assuming http://nodejs.org/[node.js/npm] is already installed:

....
sudo npm install -g bower gulp typescript
npm install
bower install 
gulp
....

If you want to build a single component use the suffix -[name_of_the_component] (names are based on the names of
directories in the plugins directory) to the build task, like:

....
gulp build-metrics
....

To test your component in browser, use the respective connect task, i.e.:

....
gulp connect-metrics
....

For further detail the Hawt.io plugin structure is described https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/blob/master/docs/Overview2dotX.md[here].
